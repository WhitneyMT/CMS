<h1>Claims Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The CMS was developed on behalf of the GDHS. The purpose of the system is to capture and track claims projects within the department. The system was outsourced and privately developed by a third party vendor. The system operates on a Java and Oracle 9i platform, running on Microsoft operating system.

GDHS has subsequently sent through a request for assistance to SITA with regards to the upgrading of the CMS. This will entail an upgrade of the current JAVA and Oracle platforms to the latest versions. Upon receipt of the request a team was assembled by SITA to assess the current GDHS Claims Management System environment and the following recommendation were given:

- Upgrade the system, this would mean that GDHS would continue with the platform upgrade as intended leading to the same difficulties being experienced, at significant amount of resource time and exorbitant cost.
- Acquisition of the commercial off-the-shelf system (COTS), this option would still require additional customization to the department’s unique requirements.
- Complete code re – write, the option would modernise the application and transform it to open standards that will make it less to develop, implement and maintain.
